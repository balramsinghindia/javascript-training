       1. To create a set Timeout function with time as two seconds.

             var count = 0;

            setTimeout( function() {} , 2000 , count);

        2. That function should change the slides one by one after every two seconds  

               i) for the first 2000 ms , the function should a value as 1 to showslide ,
               ii) for the second 2000ms , the function should a value as 2 to Showslide ,
               iii) for the third 2000ms , the function should a value as 3 to Showslide , 
              iv) for the fourth 2000ms , the function should a value as 4 to Showslide , 
              iv) for the fiveth 2000ms , the function should a value as 5 to Showslide , 


            function (+1){
                    showslide(+1) ;
            }
 


          setTimeout ( function (count+1) {
                      
                      showslide(count+1)
                
          }, 2000 , count +1 )
